Bug Report: DELETE Request on /employee/{id} Endpoint

Issue Summary:
The DELETE endpoint /employee/{id} is designed to accept an employee ID of UUID type. However, the endpoint returns incorrect status codes for invalid UUID formats and valid but non-existent UUIDs.

Scenarios:

1. Scenario Description: DELETE request with employee ID as a numeric string instead of a UUID
   Employee ID: "12345"
   Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
   Actual Status: 405 (Method Not Allowed)

2. Scenario Description: DELETE request with employee ID as a non-numeric string instead of a UUID
   Employee ID: "foo"
   Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
   Actual Status: 405 (Method Not Allowed)

3. Scenario Description: DELETE request with employee ID as a number instead of a UUID
   Employee ID: 1234
   Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
   Actual Status: 405 (Method Not Allowed)

4. Scenario Description: DELETE request with employee ID as null
   Employee ID: null
   Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
   Actual Status: 405 (Method Not Allowed)

5. Scenario Description: DELETE request with employee ID as an invalid UUID
   Employee ID: "375ceaca-b04c-4624-bbaa-7183dd5895bb"
   Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
   Actual Status: 200 (OK)

6. Scenario Description: DELETE request with employee ID that looks like a UUID but is not
   Employee ID: "375ceaca-b04c-4624-bbxx-7183dd5895xx"
   Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
   Actual Status: 405 (Method Not Allowed)

Expected Behavior:
- When the employee ID is not in UUID format, the endpoint should return a 400 Bad Request status.
- When the employee ID is in UUID format but is invalid or non-existent, the endpoint should return a 400 Bad Request status.

Actual Behavior:
- The endpoint returns a 405 Method Not Allowed status for non-UUID formatted employee IDs.
- The endpoint returns a 200 OK status for an invalid UUID.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Send a DELETE request to /employee/{id} with the employee ID as specified in each scenario above.
2. Observe the status code returned by the endpoint.
