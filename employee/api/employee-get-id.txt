Bug Report: GET Request on /employee/{id} Endpoint

Issue Summary:
The GET endpoint /employee/{id} is designed to accept an employee ID of UUID type. However, the endpoint returns incorrect status codes for invalid UUID formats and valid but non-existent UUIDs.

Scenarios:

	1.	Scenario Description: GET request with employee ID as a numeric string instead of a UUID
		Employee ID: “12345”
		Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
		Actual Status: 500 (Internal Server Error)

	2.	Scenario Description: GET request with employee ID as a non-numeric string instead of a UUID
		Employee ID: “foo”
		Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
		Actual Status: 500 (Internal Server Error)

	3.	Scenario Description: GET request with employee ID as a number instead of a UUID
		Employee ID: 1234
		Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
		Actual Status: 500 (Internal Server Error)

	4.	Scenario Description: GET request with employee ID as an invalid UUID
		Employee ID: “375ceaca-b04c-4624-bbaa-7183dd5895bb”
		Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
		Actual Status: 200 (OK)

	5.	Scenario Description: GET request with employee ID that looks like a UUID but is not
		Employee ID: “375ceaca-b04c-4624-bbxx-7183dd5895xx”
		Expected Status: 400 (Bad Request)
		Actual Status: 500 (Internal Server Error)

Expected Behavior:
	-	When the employee ID is not in UUID format, the endpoint should return a 400 Bad Request status.
	-	When the employee ID is in UUID format but is invalid or non-existent, the endpoint should return a 400 Bad Request status.

Actual Behavior:
	-	The endpoint returns a 500 Internal Server Error status for non-UUID formatted employee IDs.
	-	The endpoint returns a 200 OK status for an invalid UUID.

Steps to Reproduce:
	1.	Send a GET request to /employee/{id} with the employee ID as specified in each scenario above.
	2.	Observe the status code returned by the endpoint.
